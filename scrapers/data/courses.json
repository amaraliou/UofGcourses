In the first part of this course: 'Religion and the Social World', we will look at how researchers such as Durkheim, Marx, Turner, Gluckman and Geertz have studied the relationship between social structure, culture and individuals within the context of religion. We will consider the role that religion and ritual can play in the creation, maintenance and manipulation of gender and ethnic identities. We will also look at theories of secularization and how this relates to modernity and increased individualism. In the second part of the course, 'Theories of Ritual and Ritualization', we will examine some of the classic theorists in this field such as Durkheim, Van Gennep, Turner, Bell and Humphrey, and Laidlaw. In particular, we will look at theories of rites of passage, symbolism and ritualization. This section ends with a consideration of pilgrimage, which will allow us to bring together theories from sections one and two of this course. In the final part of this course: 'Religion, Power and Change', we will look at how religions and indeed individual's religious beliefs can change either as a response to, or in reaction against, wider social, political and economic changes within a context of power relations. In particular, we will examine studies of syncretism and religious conversion.

Cosmology refers to understandings of the universe as an ordered whole. In many cultures, this understanding is primarily a religious world view. Cosmologies not only provide an explanation of why the natural environment is the way it is, they also explain the nature of human existence and how people should relate to each other and to the world around them. We will begin this course by looking at a cross-cultural range of cosmologies from both small scale societies, such as Australian Aborigines or Amazonian Indians, and\u00a0world religions, such as Islam. We will then look at various theories that anthropologists have offered to help us understand how humans order and relate to the world around them. This will include considering some classic works (Tylor on animism; Douglas on classification, purity and danger; Geertz on religion as a cultural system; and Levi-Strauss on myth analysis) and critiques of these studies. The final part of the course\u00a0will look critically at what constitutes knowledge and how we are to deal with people whose understanding of how the world works is very different from our own. Anthropologists attempt to understand cultural phenomenon from 'the native's point of view'. However, it is difficult to avoid being influenced by the views of our own culture (including the views of the academic disciplines we have been trained in). We will explore issues of knowledge, rationality and 'science' by focusing on how anthropologists,\u00a0and other social scientists,\u00a0have studied fundamentalism, shamanism, witchcraft, and 'native' notions of human conception.

However, amidst claims about 'the end of multiculturalism', the relationship between migration, social cohesion and national values has become an increasingly contentious political issue. How we live with difference is the subject of continued political, public and media interest. The course combines an exploration of key theoretical and conceptual frameworks from sociology and related disciplines with the analysis of empirical material foregrounding the perspectives of migrants themselves as well as political and policy perspectives. Central to the course is the exploration of key debates around citizenships, diversity, multiculturalism, belonging and social cohesion. We will explore the role these debates play in migrants' sense of home and belonging, as well as look at how difference is experienced and negotiated on an everyday basis in UK cities and neighbourhoods. Drawing from sociological, social-anthropological and policy debates, we will address questions such as: what different forms of citizenship exist and how might these be practiced in society? How do migrants forge a sense of identity and belonging across geopolitical and cultural borders? What is the relationship between racial and ethno-cultural diversity and citizenship? What facilitates or hinders the integration of settled migrant groups and individuals? How do policies on migrant integration and multiculturalism compare across the UK, Scotland and other European countries? What is their impact on the lives of migrant groups?

The course then explores the impact of globalisation following the oil crisis of 1973 and subsequent instability, and looks at developing nations and environmental concerns in the later decades of the 20th century.

Cotemporary Planning Systems (CPS) introduces you to the complex and contentious world of urban spatial planning. Not only does CPS familiarise you with the institutional and legal context within which planning takes place; it also helps you development critical perspectives on planning systems, how they have evolved and why they function the way they do.  To this end such CPS introduces and critically engages contemporary planning practices, debates, controversies, issues and concerns. It critically retraces the history of planning and explains this has shaped contemporary systems and practice.

Often this involves sociologists saying something is wrong or 'unfair' so, if we say something is wrong or unfair, what's the alternative? This is a question sociologists have been dealing with since the beginning of the discipline: should sociologists offer alternatives and, if they should, how should they go about it? These are the questions you will study on this course. We will consider whether sociology should be about saying what should happen, or whether it is a discipline concerned simply with explaining what is; to put it in the correct terminology, is sociology a value-free discipline? From here we will look at the alternatives some sociologists and social theorists, such as Durkheim, Du Bois, Mead, Dworkin, Mannheim, Marcuse, Giddens and Levitas have offered and consider the role sociologists should play.  Among these alternatives are questions such as: should inheritance be banned? Would a distinct co-operative economic structure help lessen racial inequality? Should sociologists teach us what we norms we should follow? Should we ban pornography? Would a basic income lessen economic inequality? And what does it mean to say we should be led by a concern not for profit but for beauty? From there we will discuss whether, in furthering such ideas, sociologists should be taking to the streets with social movements, organising in the local community, working for the government to create policy or writing newspaper articles/appearing on TV to contribute to public debate?  Since sociology in the 21st Century is greatly concerned with being a 'public' sociology this course is your opportunity to think about how it should go about doing this."}, "POLITIC5067": {"school": "School of Social and Political Sciences", "title": "Internship and language in China", "url": "https://www.gla.ac.uk/coursecatalogue/course/?code=POLITIC5067", "level": 5, "offeredin": "Summer", "credits": 20, "session": "2017-18", "visiting": true, "desc": "Students will spend eight weeks (May to July) in China\u00a0where they will have the opportunity to gain first-hand experience of Chinese society and culture.

The aim of this module is to explore the idea of Russia almost two decades on from 1991: as a 'state' and 'nation' which has gone through, and is still engaged in, the process of re-negotiating its identity at the global, national, regional, and local levels. The course examines internal and external issues of relevance in the contemporary period (including Russia's relations with the West and the countries of the former Soviet Union, particularly Central Asia; internal and external migration; the role and identity of Russian Diaspora communities, the role of religion and Islam; the existence and nature of ethnic conflict), and explores how in these different spheres identities are being re-shaped both at the level of the Russian state and the level of the Russian people. The module adopts an approach that combines utilisation of key theoretical and conceptual frameworks (nationalism, ethnicity, globalisation, post-colonialism) with analysis of more grounded empirical perspectives. The module makes reference to Russia's historical (imperial) past (which is covered during a first semester module: Constructing Identities in Soviet Russia: Local, National and Global Perspectives)."}, "VETSCI5020": {"school": "School of Veterinary Medicine", "title": "Advances in Veterinary Biosciences", "url": "https://www.gla.ac.uk/coursecatalogue/course/?code=VETSCI5020", "level": 5, "offeredin": 2, "credits": 10, "session": "2017-18", "erasmus": false, "visiting": false, "desc": "This course is designed to give students an understanding of current knowledge\u00a0in veterinary bioscience and the ability to judge the values of innovative and pioneering research into the underlying problems of veterinary medicine and science."}, "DUMF1009": {"school": "School of Interdisciplinary Studies", "title": "Contemporary Health Issues", "url": "https://www.gla.ac.uk/coursecatalogue/course/?code=DUMF1009", "level": 1, "offeredin": 1, "credits": 20, "session": "2017-18", "erasmus": true, "visiting": true, "desc": "This course\u00a0introduces students to the social study of health and health care in modern Britain, with a considerable local focus.
